<h2> <font color="#800080" face="Impact, sans-serif">Hobby 1: Play Videogames!</font></h2>
<p align="justify"> I really love playing videogames, it's a love I've always had since I was a child, when, one Christmas, my parents gave me a Gamecube and the Mario Kart game, when I played for first time I felt very excited, because I couldn't belive how easy was convert yourself in a other person when you play, because with the videogames you can save a princess, compete in a race to save the world, be the Tri-force hero, or be whatever you want, and I really love feel that experiences, experiences than other things never be able to give you. </p>
<h2> <font color="#191970" face="Impact, sans-serif">Hobby 2: Watch Anime series!</font></h2>
<p align="justify"> This is a strange hobby, but I like watch Anime, because you can find a lot of different stories than you cannot find in other types of animations or cartoons, I started to wacht it when I was in the highschool, because a friend challenge me, but actually I enjoy watch it. </p>
